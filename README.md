# OpenAI API Quickstart - Python example app

This is a repo originally from openai as an example app in Flask,

I've coded with tkinter for practicing purposes, will follow up with a flask project to practice and review python.

Will complete the first tkinter one to have a chat-box like function and then image display for dall.e compatibility.

After that, I'll transfer these functions to a web-like application.

Binded the keys, mostly done with tkinter, starting the webapp with flsk
